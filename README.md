# Human activity recognition is the problem of classifying sequences of data recorded by specialized harnesses or smart phones into known well-defined Human activities. It is a challenging problem as the large number of observations are produced each second, the temporal nature of the observations, and the lack of a clear way to relate data to known movements increase the challenges.
